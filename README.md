# TwitterBot
a bot for replacing words or phrases in found tweets

Import a "mykeys.py" file which contains your personal keys.
to make it work, run the bot in command line like this:

python bot.py aStringToReplace replacement n=numberoftweets t=periodoftweeting

with the first run the app will create a 'log.txt' file to log what's happening (tweets that've been posted and errors that've been received)
